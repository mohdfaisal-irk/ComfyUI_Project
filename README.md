ComfyUI Workflows
This repository aims to be a curated collection of awesome ComfyUI workflows that serve two main purposes:

Help people learn ComfyUI through practical examples
Provide immediately reproducible workflows with complete API formats and dependencies
Each workflow is stored as a JSON file and includes all necessary configurations, making it easy to:

Understand how different ComfyUI nodes work together
Learn best practices for workflow design
Deploy workflows instantly with ComfyUI Deploy
Share and reproduce complex AI image generation pipelines
Directory Structure
Workflows are organized by category:

workflows/florence2/: Florence2 model related workflows
workflows/stable-diffusion/: Stable Diffusion related workflows
workflows/controlnet/: ControlNet related workflows
Standardization
This repository hopes to follows standardization guidelines to ensure workflows work across different cloud providers:

Environment variables for API keys and endpoints
Standardized model download paths
Consistent node naming conventions
Version-locked dependencies
Cloud-agnostic storage paths
Roadmap
Short-term Goals
 Add more example workflows for common use cases
 Implement automated workflow testing
 Create workflow documentation templates
 Add model validation checks
 Support for more cloud providers
Contributing
When adding new workflows:

Create a new JSON file in the appropriate category directory
Follow the established format for nodes and connections
Include all necessary environment configurations
Test the workflow before committing
Add model information and hashes
Follow standardization guidelines
Technical Details
Workflow Format
A workflow JSON file consists of several main sections:

1. Basic Structure
{
    "extra": {},
    "links": [...],
    "nodes": [...],
    "config": {},
    "groups": [],
    "version": float,
    "last_link_id": int,
    "last_node_id": int,
    "workflow_api": {...},  // Contains the API configuration for the workflow
    "environment": {...}    // Specifies runtime requirements and dependencies
}
2. Key Components
Environment
The environment section specifies runtime requirements:

comfyui_version: Version of ComfyUI
gpu: Required GPU type
docker_command_steps: Custom node installations
python_version: Required Python version
